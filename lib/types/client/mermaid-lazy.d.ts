 * - drop backticks — lexically illegal in mermaid labels (models embed
 *   ```dsh-ui style fences, which break the parser with "Lexical error");
 * - strip `<br/>` tags, which require htmlLabels (never enabled here);
 * - quote unquoted node labels containing CJK, spaces, or other characters
 *   mermaid's bare-label grammar rejects (observed live: `A[模型生成 spec]`).
 * Conservative by design: already-quoted labels, plain ASCII labels without
 * spaces, and non-flowchart kinds are left untouched (apart from the
 * backtick/`<br/>` sanitation above, which is harmless everywhere in a
 * flowchart).
 *
 * Labeled-edge spans (`-- 文本 -->`, `== 文本 ==>`, `-. 文本 .->`) are free
 * text and must never be quoted: wrapping them breaks the parser
 * ("Expecting 'LINK' … got 'STR'"), observed live with
 * `H -- 否(流式中) --> J`. Each span is swapped for a bracket-free
 * placeholder before quoting and restored verbatim afterwards, so the quote
 * pass can neither corrupt it nor be thrown off by inserted quotes
 * elsewhere on the line.
