 * dsh-genui browser half: registers the `dsh-ui` fence renderer with
 * MarkdownText via the fence-registry extension point shipped by
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`, the keyed toolview for the
 * `render_ui` tool (renders the tool's result card in the tool row), and the
 * session panel dock (re-renders the latest render_ui spec IN PLACE above
 * the composer, so repeated calls update one surface instead of stacking).
 *
 * The renderer parses the fence body with the partial parser: while the reply
 * streams, every FINISHED component appears the moment its JSON object
 * closes, so the UI assembles top-down before the fence (or reply) completes.
 * A body with no finished component yet falls back to a plain code block,
 * re-evaluated per chunk. Action callbacks (v2 event loop) are not threaded
 * here — GenuiBlock reads them from GenuiActionContext, installed by the
 * markdown host (fences) or by the panel component (dock).
